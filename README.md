Multiple data sources focused on bikesharing in space were considered for the analysis. The most important is BikeSharingWorldMap, which provides information from multiple sources in one web map. The Bike Share Map web map, which tracks the status of bikes at the current time, can also be considered among the extensive sources of information.

The analysis included several characteristics (elevation, slope, distance to sea), which were obtained by calculation in the ArcGIS Pro software environment from ESRI.
